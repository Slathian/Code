                Who am I?
                <h1>My name is Josh, I was born in 1998, November 12th. My youngest years took me from America, to Denmark, where I learned the language and started school there until mid Elementary. I came back to America and lived in Lake Oswego Oregon, attending school there until I sought to move to Corvallis Oregon in 2019. In the past 10 years, my mother has found her roots from which she was adopted from where  I learned that I am part Marshallese. The Marshallese people live in the South Pacific of the Marshall Islands, and my people are those from Namdrik Atoll where one day I plan to visit.</h1>
