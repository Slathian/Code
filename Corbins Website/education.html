            </div>

            <div class="item info">
                <h2>
                    There is a problem with record deals signed between artists and labels. The problem has negatively impacted the signed artists because of dense complex contracts with clauses that ultimately affect the artist’s freedom and income detrimentally. A possible cause for this problem is a lack of awareness among the artists signing into these deals and an increase in competition within the music industry. The stakeholders involved in this community and tasked with addressing this problem are artists, record labels, and possibly the artist’s manager as they make a percentage of the artist’s earnings.

                <h2>
                    Royalties are “payments that go to recording artists, songwriters, composers, publishers, and other copyright holders for the right to use their intellectual property” (PQ). Royalties are the only way for artists to collect income from physical music sales, making royalty negotiation extremely important.
                    Royalties are a negotiable topic but the flexibility from labels is not very high. According to Donald S. Passman, a practicing entertainment lawyer for over 25 years, author of All You Need To Know About The Music Business, royalties are decided based upon how much “heat” an artist has generated around their name. Artists with a minor amount of heat could see 15% to 17% of their royalty check, moderate to heavy heat could land 17% to 20% of the royalties, and best of all, a superstar can obtain 20% plus (Passman 92). Even if an artist is pulling massive numbers as a superstar they will only pull 20% royalties from songs. If signing a record contract is the best move for an artist it is essential that they sign an entertainment lawyer of some sort to oversee the contract to ensure minimal exploitation.

            <div class="item info">
                <h2>
                    One type of deal is a 360 deal, where labels impede into different aspects of the music publishing, distribution, recording, live performance, and merchandise sales. Most contracts allow for assistance in publishing, distribution, and recording, but the additions of live performances and merchandise sales take profits from the artist’s main streams of revenue. According to What Streaming Music Services Pay (Updated for 2019) by Daniel Sanchez the streaming service Spotify, pays out $0.00397 per stream, which means it would take 251,889 streams to earn $1000 from Spotify. Keep in mind that the $1000 from streaming services falls under the artists’ contract with the record labels under distribution. Only the most listened to artists pull major profits from streams leaving the most profitable forms of income to artists tours and merchandise. Artists who sign into these contracts, unaware of the fresh environment they are stepping into, are left counting their losses as labels profit from all forms of the artist’s income.
